Thanks are due to Dr. Robert Meier <eaglecoach@wwnet.com> for suggestionns
and simplifications of the basic algorithms for Ostiary, as well as some
extensions of the rpm spec file.

Portions of the code were adapted from "Advanced Programming in the Unix
Environment", by W. Richard Stevens. The 'clock cache' code is inspired
by "Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries" by Don Libes.

The SHA1 code is adapted from Steve Reid's public-domain SHA1
implementation.

The autoconf files were developed with the invaluable assistance of Mark
Galassi's autoconf tutorial, located at
"http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/autoconf_tutorial_toc.html".
The autoconf macros to implement libwrap checking were taken from the
apcupsd package.

Bennett Todd <bet@rahul.net> created the RPM support and the ostiary.spec
file, and brought HMAC to my attention.

John Stamp <kinsayder@hotmail.com> corrected several bugs and clarified
several of the debugging messages.
